# Chick Placement for Brooding

Handling of day-old chicks and management of the brooding program have a direct relationship on chicken productivity. A newly hatched chick cannot regulate its body temperature Arti?cial brooding provides the right temperature for the chicks.

NOTE: Effective chick management begins before the arrival of day-o|d chick

Prerequisites for brooding:
1. Brooding houses should be isolated from other houses containing older birds. The farmer should follow an ”aII-in, all-ouf’program. Never mix birds of different ages.
2. All facilities must thoroughly be cleaned, and disinfected before the arrival of chicks (Fig. 22 and 23).

3. Before the arrival of chicks the brooder ring and heaters must be checked to ensure that they are working properly.
4. On arrival chicks should be offered fresh feed and water containing an antistress or glucose where chicks are stressed.

## Preparation for chick placement

+ Feeders and drinkers should be cleaned and disinfected two days before use.
+ All equipment should be arranged and the litter spread.
+ The brooder ring should be prepared and curtains fixed on the open sides for insulation of the brooder house. Spray with good quality disinfectant two days before the chicks arrive.
+ Provide a foot bath at the entrance with lime powder or any other disinfectant.   


## Preparation for a Brooder Gaurd
Cut an 8 x 4 ft hardboard sheet or the equivalent into two equal parts lengthwise and join the pieces to form a circle as described in Fig. 24 below.   

The brooder should be ready prior to disinfection. Fill the ring with suitable litter material such as wood shavings (not saw dust) or straw, up to 4 inches thick from the floor, and then spread newspapers to cover the litter on the floor. The heat source should be placed at the centre of the brooder ring. Expand the brooder ring regularly to
create space for the growing chicks.

## Chick Examination

Examine the chick crops 12 hours after placement to ensure they have found feed and water. About 95% of the crops should feel soft and pliable indicating chicks have successfully located feed and water. Hard crops indicate chicks have not found adequate water. Swollen and distended crops indicate chicks have located water but insufficient feed. Rearrange the drinkers and the feeder to enhance accessibility by the Chicks.   

## Feed Management

The use of open feeding trays at placement is recommended to help chicks locate feed easily. Provide 1 chick feeding tray measuring 30 x 45 cm (1 x 1 V2 ft) per 100 chicks placed between the main feeder and drinkers adjacent to the heat source. Use open feeders for the first 7 - 10 days.

## Light Management

Continuous lighting should be provided for the first 48 -72 hours after placement to help Chicks find feed and water.

## Brooding Temperature

The ideal brooding temperature (320 C during the 1st week) is measured at the edge of the brooder guard and 5 cm above the litter surface. The best time to observe the Chicks and make temperature adjustment should be during the coldest times of the day. Thermometers may not always be available. Use the chick behavior as illustrated in Fig. 26.   



## Chick Behaviour

Just Right : Contantly cheeping chicks evenly spread
Too Draughty: Noisy chick huddled together away from draught
Too Cold: Noisy chicks huddled under brooder
Too Hot: Drowsy chicks spread around perimeter

Adequate floor, feeder and drinking spaces should be provided. Maintain optimal relative humidity, light and ventilation for the chicks comfort.   


## Induction of Chicke

1. Light the brooder heat source an hour prior to chick arrival so that the ring temperature is 32°C.
2. Count the chicks on arrival.
3. Allow the chicks to take water before introducing feed in a chick feeding tray or clean egg tray.
4. For the first 3 days observe the Chicks every 2-3 hours to ensure they have taken feed and water.

Reduce temperatures in the brooder at the rate 01‘20 C every week. This will ensure that the Chicks adapt to the ambient temperatures of 18 - 220 C after the brooding period of 28 days.

## Chick Mortality

It is important to investigate the causes of early chick mortality as this can be prevented. Moortality maybe caused by low or high brooding temperatures, feed poisoning, fungal, toxins, litter poisoning (ingestion of sawdust), injuries through rough handling, pro—longed transportation stress, starvation, humidity, nutrition deficiency, genetic disorder, and predators among others.
