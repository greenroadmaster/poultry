# Poultry Selection and Breeding

## Chicken Selection
Selection of healthy chicken is important to ensure a health flock with high productivity, It is important to look for different features in chicks, grmvers, hens and cocks. Select or buy  new chicken early in the day. as stress from lack of water, feed and rest. will make them look sickfy. The key features to look for are;

### Chick
+ Shiny, dry, thick and coloured down feathers
+ Soft belly
+ Clean, dry navel and clean feathers around the vent
+ Thick shanks with spaced straight toes
+ Big clear eyes
+ Lively behaviour

### Grower, Layers and Cocks
+ Should appear healthy and lively 
+ Feathering shiny and normal (depends on the breed)
+ Large size for the age
+ Eyes clear and shiny
+ Clean, dry beaks and nostrils
+ Clean feathers around the vent
+ Straight legs and toes
+ Males are large relative to the hens and are mostly alert and protective   


### Additional feature for a healthy good layer
+ A red comb (more coloured when in lay
+ Legs less coloured in lay
+ The breast bone should not be too sharp
+ A big broad bottom (laying status can be checked, see Fig.7 below)  

Fig.7: Features of laying hen
+ When in lay, 2 or more fingers fit between the pelvic / pubic bones

+ When not in lay only one finger can fit between the pelvic / pubic bones

+ In small flocks, it is relatively easy to check whether they are in lay. The distance between the pubic bones Will be equivalent to three fingers, When the hen is in lay and one finger when not in lay.

+ A laying hen Will have a long shiny comb and will be heavier that, non laying Which Will have a small shrive/led comb

## Breeding
A breed is a group of chicken with unique features inherited from their parents. Features such as the, colour of comb, ear lobes and shank are usually determined by breed. A breed could have variations in plumage colour.
Thus a white and a black hen mayjust be different variants of the same breed. 

## Different types of chicken breeds
Frizzled feathers, Naked-neck, Dwarf and the Normal type are commonly found in the warm regions (Figure 7). Naked-neck and Frizzled feathers are likely to be a natural adaptation to heat stress. Dwarf poultry show standard colours and plumage, but tend to be 2/3 of the normal size for poultry, mostly because of the short shanks.

## Chicken Selection
Chicken in commercial systems are kept for either eggs, meat or both products. It is important to select chicken suitable for a specific production system, environment and market.
Some distinct features of commercial chicken aree shown in Figure 8.
1. Layers are ”boat—shaped” with a strong straight back.
2. Meat Chicken e.g. broilers have long-legs and are more upright with more developed breast muscles
3. A duaI-purpose breed e.g. KALRO improved chicken is a form in between the layers and meat chicken.

Improved breed require better management in order to achieve their production potential. They are therefore not suited for free—range production system.

## Cross-breeding
To increase production from local chicken, crossbreeding is practiced. Consult a breeder for suitable breeds to increase egg production, growth or both. To avoid inbreeding change the breeding cock after every generation (every 6 months). The best option is to purchase the breeding cock from reputable ?rms e.g. KALRO. Inbreeding is mating of closely related individuals which can lead to expression of undesirable traits.
