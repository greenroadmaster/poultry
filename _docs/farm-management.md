# Consept of sustainable poultry farm

To achive a good global food system, in four aspects as pollution and antibiotic use, biodiversity (environmental aspects), conditions for farm workers and animal welfare (social aspects), governance of the food chain (institutional aspects), and the development of poultry from a valuable food to a cheap staple food throughout major parts of the world (economic aspects), there are numerous potential pathways for sustainable development of poultry production. 

In this study to show up of a sample practice to do poultry business as local production provides potential for production with minimum transport and, concomitantly, minimum usage of fossil fuels. Among the terrestrial animals, poultry has the best conversion rate of feed to human food and the smallest environmental footprint in terms of energy and water use per kg meat or eggs produced.

Furthermore talk about good poultry because poultry are living, sentient animals that can be well integrated into many different types of urban and rural farming systems, where they benefit from and contribute to such systems and to the livelihood of households around the globe, with special emphasis on women. 

so it would be talk about steps to Start a Poultry Business regarding initiation, planning, execution, performance/monitoring, and project close with financing as Arranging funds: Credit requirements to meet the working capital requirements like buying equipment and machinery, purchase of raw materials, paying-off salaries, manage cash flow, etc.

The overall goal of planning research is to demonstrate how whole-farm planning models can be adapted to evaluate a potential operation. Specific objectives are
1) to present how whole farm resources such as machinery, labor, and time constraints were collected and inventoried and 
2) determine how additional rented land affects crop mix and machinery resource requirements. Data specific is enter into an existing whole-farm linear programming model for regional- and farm-specific information. 
3) Farm-specific parameters included labor, machinery, crop rotations, and available acreage. Results indicated additional fieldwork could be completed with available labor and machinery. The process of adapting planning models is of interest to a wide spectrum of Extension personnel; 
and model results are applicable beyond the case study farm to other beginning farmers, farms anticipating intergenerational transition, and succession planning specialists.

## Cost of Goods Sold in Poultry Farm
Financial
If you look at a Profit/Loss statement (also called an Income Statement), you will often see Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) broken out from other expenses.  What are these and why break them apart?

Costs of Goods Sold are expenses that are directly attributed to the amount of production. COGS are reported on the Income Statement and are segregated from Operating Expenses, which are expenses that are not directly tied to production. 

Let’s use the example of a farm that raises livestock and sells meat. You can see in the lists below that COGS will fluctuate greatly depending on the quantity produced. If the farm were to increase from raising 4 animals to 10, feed costs and processing costs (COGS) would substantially increase because those expenses are directly tied to production, but insurance and rent (Operating Expenses) would likely stay the same. 

Costs of Good Sold

Animal Feed & Minerals Expense
Vet & Medical
Replacement Animals
USDA Processing Cost
Packaging

Operating Expenses

Hauling  Expense  
Marketing
Fuel & Oil|
Insurance
Licenses & Permits
Utilities
Office Expenses
Rent
Repair & Maintenance
Subscriptions & Dues

Only production costs, not sales and management, are included in COGS. That can get tricky with labor.  Labor associated with production should be included in COGS, but labor associated with marketing or management should go in your operating expenses.  

Why does it matter? Knowing a business’ COGS helps evaluate profitability.  The number that remains after you subtract COGS from your total revenue is known as your gross profit.  Different products within a farm business have different COGS, and as such, different levels of gross profit. A farm business might choose to raise more beef and less eggs (or vice versa) after figuring out the gross profit for each enterprise.

The cost of goods sold is operating expenses directly related to the production of the products i.e. agricultural produce such as vegetables, seeds, and saplings the business sells. COGS should include the cost of labor, inputs, and materials used and the portions of overhead related to production.

Small farms are complicated businesses for COGS calculations since there are few clear distinctions between production, sales, management, etc. The labor cost is generally split between harvesting, selling at the market, and bookkeeping.

However, the cost of harvesting labor is only included in COGS. It becomes difficult to allocate overhead costs between production and other business functions. The various costs in agriculture company are as follows:

Field Costs By acre
These are seasonal costs meaning these are irregular in nature and occur only in particular months of the year preferably before the seeds are harvested:

Cost of regular labor as starting seeds, watering, transplanting, staking and weeding
Cost of potting soil and trays
Cost of seeds
Cost of black plastics or amendments

All the above costs are also considered as cost of supplies or cost of direct labor for agriculture company

Field costs by the case
These costs are incurred in each of the vegetable cases wisely. Suppose, the company is growing cauliflower then, the cost would be all those components of the cost that are related to the growth of cauliflower. These are

Cost of labor such as harvesting, sorting, and packaging
Cost of supplies
Item wise cost of goods sold
Costs of Goods Sold are expenses that are directly attributed to the amount of production. COGS are reported on the Income Statement and are segregated from Operating Expenses, which are expenses that are not directly tied to production. These include:

Animal Feed & Minerals Expense
Vet & Medical
Replacement Animals
USDA Processing Cost
Packaging
Statement of Cost of Services Rendered

Cost of goods and services	 	XX
-Ending inventory	 	(X)

Knowing COGS is very important to analyze the profitability of the business.  Different products within a farm business have different COGS, and as such, different levels of gross profit. Labor associated with production is added to COGS while linked with marketing and sales is added to operating expenses.

이번 편에서는 농장관리에서 기타내용은 차치하고 매출총이익을 중심으로 실증적인 농장관리에 대해 말하고자 한다. 

파이낸스는 자본시장에서 돈으로 불리는 것을 만들어내고 관리하며 연구하는 일련의 활동이라고 한다. 

농장관리에서 생산과 판매를 관리하는 기본툴은 바로 자본시장에서 돈으로 환원되며, NPV와 IRR로 모든 것을 판별할 수 있다. 

농장은 크게 생산과 판매로 나누어지며, 이를 파이낸스로 관리한다. 

앞으로 머신러닝 시대가 오면 수작업이 한결 간결해지고 세부적인 데이터가 반영될 수 있지만 그 때까지는 주요 구성요소만으로 결정하기 까지 농장주로서 고생하기 바란다. 


# SWOT Analysis with Financing

지금까지 개발된 농장관리지수는 많다. 이 많은 평가항목으로 우리가 찾는 것은 구성항목들의 강점과 약점을 구분하고 약점을 보완하는 것이다. 

## Know your self (SWOT Analysis)

## 강점과 약점
생각이 많으면 실천이 어렵다. 실무경험을 중심으로 SWOT을 분석하는 것을 말한다. 
생산비를 기준으로 항목당 비용이 평균보다 적으면 강점이며, 평균보다 높으면 단점이 된다. 
단점이 나쁜것 만은 아니며, 누적된 데이터를 통해 단점을 찾아내고 가용한 LEM을 통해 개선점을 찾아내면 된다. 

## 위기와 기회
정책변화, 시장개척 등 외부정보에 의해 우리농장이 기회가 찾아올지 위기가 찾아올지 분석하는 것으로 
위기는 통상 통지, 계도, 시행의 3단계이므로 너무 조급하지 말고 파이낸셜에 비추어 유리한 방향으로 설계하면 된다.

based on the farm
specific data and climate, i.e., temperature, humidity, 
initial age (IA), 
initial body weight (IBW), 
number of pigs (NU) and 
stocking density (SD). 
The growth data used in our work is collected from 55 pig farms which are located across South Korea for the period between October 2017 and September 2018. In the estimation of growth performance, four machine learning schemes are applied, which are the logistic regression, linear support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and random forest. Through the evaluation, we confirm that the accuracy of estimation for growth performance can be improved by 28% using machine learning techniques compared to the base line performance which is obtained by the ZeroR classifier. We also find that the
accuracy of estimation is heavily dependent on the pre-process of growth data.


## Object(Target) of Farm production

The main objects of both sustainable farming and conventional farming are exactly the same: 
+ soil management
+ crop management
+ water management
+ Disease/pest management
+ waste management. 

It's the methods used that are often radically different.
