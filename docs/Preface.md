# Preface

Organic agriculture has emerged as a sustainable farming system which has great
impact on socioeconomic status of small farmers in rural areas, particularly of
developing countries. This system of farming enhances soil and ecosystem health
by avoiding the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and recycles farm waste,
making the system self-sustainable. With increasing health awareness, current
increasing interest in organic agriculture is favored for health as well as environ-
mental and food quality concerns. Currently, the land under organic farming is
*40 m ha with a market value of *US$65 billion. Australia, China, and India are
increasingly growing farming under organic. I am pleased to present a timely
compilation on “Organic Farming for Sustainable Agriculture” under the series on
“Sustainable Development and Biodiversity” after a very successful first book on
Sustainable Horticultural Systems: Issues, Technology and Innovation (2014).
“Organic Farming for Sustainable Agriculture” book is contributed by authors
from the entire gamut of agricultural disciplines who are distributed throughout the
globe, particularly developing countries, which is the region impacted the most by
climate change and excessive use of chemical farming. Organic farming practices
are resilient and becoming increasingly important due to pressing needs to protect
the air, soils, and water; to improve socioeconomic conditions of farmers, farm
workers, and rural communities; and to provide healthy, safe, and nutritious hor-
ticultural products to a rapidly increasing world population.
This book gathers review articles that analyze current organic agriculture prac-
tices, principles, knowledge, and proposed solutions. This book is the most
up-to-date and comprehensive review of our knowledge on the use of innovative
technologies and issues in organic farming systems with case studies from various
regions of the world. It contains fifteen reviews on the production, practices, urban
agriculture and integrated pest management, breeding for organic farming, safety
issues, organic meat, organic certification, and health and nutrition.
The book is designed to cater to the needs of undergraduates and postgraduates
studying organic agriculture, horticulture, sustainable crop production, crop pro-
tection, agricultural sciences, integrated pest management, and plant sciences.

Research scientists in such fields as horticulture, vegetables, agriculture, and crop
protection will also find this book as a useful compilation of review articles.
Libraries in all universities and research establishments where agricultural and
horticultural sciences are studied and taught should have multiple copies of this
valuable book on their shelves.
