# Housing

Housing protects chicken against predators, thieves, adverse weather (rain, sun, cold winds, and low night temperatures) and to provide shelter for egg laying and broody hens. Suitable chicken houses are important for effcient production and management.
Chicken houses and shelters vary depending on availability of materials, weather and traditions. Type of housing should be based on cost, durability and usage.
The simplest housing is a basket system. The number of chicken housed will depend on age of the chicken and the basket size. See Fig. 10.

## Site Selection for Chicken Houses

The site should be dry and ?at or alternatively the house can be elevated from the ground. Trees and bushes close to the site will provide shade, windbreaks and protect chicken from predators. The site should be secured against predators and thieves. In a rectangular house the end walls should face East - West to ensure that only the end walls face the hot afternoon sun and wind (See Fig. 12). Clear all grass and bushes for about 3 meters on all sides of the house to keep snakes and rats away.

## Building a Chicken House

1. Use cheap and locally available material like timber, off-cuts, reeds, sisal poles and thatch grass or clay bricks.
2. Remove the bark from the wood to reduce parasites load.
3. Chicken houses should have openings on the long sides for ventilation.

In addition a hole or ridge on the roof will ensure proper ventilation. Avoid draughts (cold) inside the chicken house. High temperatures and humidity may cause deaths, a drop in egg production, low shells quality and
reduced weight gain.
To protect against the build-up ofdisease causing agents and parasites the house must be accessible (Fig. 11.) and easy to clean with a foot bath at the entrance (Fig. 12). Use slatted or raised floors (Fig. 13) to keep away droppings and avoid predators.
Remove any sharp edged objects from the house to prevent possible injury to the birds and humans.   

## Stocking Density for mature chicken

NOTE: This spacing will cater for chicken and equipments.

Deep-Litter 4-5 birds per m2   


## Importance of Perches

Perches are important for chicken to roost on and reduces pecking and fighting. Five mature chicken require 1 metre of perch. Perches are best made from rounded sticks which match the size of the chicken’s feet. They should be treated with used engine oil or kerosene to keep away parasites.   

## Nests

Laying nests ease egg collection and help avoid dirty and cracked eggs. Avoid building nests on the ground or outside chicken houses as this will expose the eggs to predators and thieves. Removing eggs frequently from the nests is important to stop hens from going broody.
There are two types of nests:
+ Battery and communal nests where more than one hen lays in the same nest. Provide one laying nest for every 5 hens.
+ Individual nests where one hen lays at a time.
+ Each laying nest should measure 45 x 45 x 45 cm (length x width x height)

Individual nests can be prepared using the following
steps:
+ Ensure the pot or basket is clean and dry;
+ Fill the pot or basket with sand mixed with ashes up to 1/3 full;
+ lace clean, soft nesting litter material (hay or straw or wood shaving) on top up to 2/3 full.

Nesting material should be kept clean to avoid dirty and contaminated eggs. Ensure that the nest is 1/3 full with litter material to avoid breakages. If necessary ”dummy eggs”(e.g. stone eggs), can be placed in the nests to train or attract hens into using the laying nests.

## Brooding Nests

Brooding nests should be placed in a quiet
and dark place.   
Nest can be made out of clay, calabashes, cardboard, wooden boxes or baskets made of local fibres. Individual nest should measure 45 x 45 cm (diameter x height).
Use ashes, tobacco leaves or other pesticides to keep off parasites.   


# Chicken Runs

Chicken runs are a fenced open air space where poultry are kept and protected against predators and thieves.
Runs are also used for feeding, watering, for daily flock observation and collection of eggs. The walls are 2 meters high and can be made of clay or woven mat or chicken wire. A chicken run is relatively costly but provides security to the poultry. Allow adult birds to scavenge outside the run during daytime to reduce feeding costs.
