# Feeds and Feeding Chicken

Feeds and feeding practices are important for maintenance ofthe Chicken and for production of meat and eggs.
Lack of feed or water will reduce resistance to diseases and parasites and subsequently increase flock mortality.
Genetic potential is limited by access to feed and water. Egg production and growth of chicken maybe improved
through supplementary feeding. Cost-benefit analysis will help to determine the most suitable feeding system.

## Amount to Feed
Chicken need feed containing energy and protein, as well as vitamins, minerals and water. Vitamins and other
nutrients are destroyed when feeds are stored for long periods or stored under sub-optimal conditions.
Knowledge of feed quality and sources of different feed types is important for feed safety. The composition and
availability of feeds will vary, depending on the season, locality and production system. The need for feed will
Change, depending on the age and status (Chicks, growers and layers) of the chicken.

Commercial diets maybe divided into the following categories, based on protein content as follows;

### Layer Chicken

1. Chick mash or starter diet is high in protein (18 — 20% crude protein) and is offered from day old to 8 weeks;
2. A growers’ mash has medium protein (15 - 17% crude protein) and is offered from 9 weeks to the start of
lay;
3. A layers’ mash has medium protein (16 - 17% crude protein) and is offered to hehs from the start of lay.


### Broiler Chicken

1. Broiler starter, which is high in protein (20 - 22 % crude protein) and offered to broiler Chicks upto 3 weeks of age.
2. Broiler finisher, which has a protein content of16 -18%, and offered to broilers between the age 3 - 6 weeks.

Before buying commercial feeds, establish whether it is profitable based on prevailing market price for eggs or meat. Indigenous chicks may be offered commercial diets profitably from day old to six weeks of age to enhance performance.
Local feed resources are the cheapest and often the best supplements for scavenging Chicken

## Scavenging Resources

Scavenging for feed is a major Characteristic of free range production systems. Chicken scavenge freely and
usually get a balanced diet.

Fig.29: Chicken Scavenging

Note: ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER SHOULD BE PROVIDED AT ALL TIMES

Scavenging resources vary between locality, season and area available. They will comprise of household waste, crop by—product, animal waste, insects and worms. In a free range or semi-ihtehsive system, growers and mature chicken Should be allowed enough time and space for scavenging in their surroundings daily. The best time for scavenging is early morning and late afternoon when there are plenty of insects and less heat. Chicks below eight weeks of age Should be confined. Supplementary feeds should be offered in the morning and evening.

## Types of Feeds

### Energy feeds
As a rule, 75% of poultry diets are made up of energy feeds. These are important for maintenance (e.g. body temperature, vital functions, exercise).

Fig 30: Energy foods
Maize, Sorghum, Cassava, Millet

Ehergy feeds include maize, white or red sorghum, millet, wheat, rice and their by-products (bran, polishing). Cassava and sweet potatoes are other sources of energy. Cassava tubers should be Chopped and dried to remove cyanide, which is poisonous. Fat is also a good source of energy particularly in hot climates.

Sources of fat are animal fats (tallow) and full fat oil seed cake. Such oils and fats should form less than 10% of the total diet.


### Protein
Protein is needed for growth and optimal health. Protein rich ingredients should form less than 20% of the diets to minimize feed cost.

Fig.31: Protein foods
Fish(omena), Termites, Sunflower seed, Shrimp, Oil seed, Cotton seed(cake)

Protein sources include; termites, insects, worms, omena, small fresh water shrimps, fish meal, oil seed cake and sweet lupin.


### Minerals

Note: The standard ratio for calcium and phosphorous is 2:1

Fig.32: Minerals

Minerals are important for bone and eggshell formation and for optimal health status. The most important mineral are calcium and phosphorous. Mature chicken are usually able to balance their mineral intake according to their requirements. Sources of minerals include: bone meal. limestone and burnt eggshells.   

### Vitamins
Vitamins are necessary for optimal health, Scavenging chicken get vitamins from green grass, vegetables, fresh cow dung and through sunlight [vitamin D). Green grass and fodder normally provide Vitamin A and D, whereas Vitamin B may come from fresh cow dung.
Supplementaryvitamins are usually not required when birds are left to scavenge. Con?ned or intensively managed chicken requires additional vitamins. This may be obtained from vitamin/mineral premix purchased from stockiest   


## Feed Mixing
It is advisable to make a balanced diet for chicks from 0 - 8 weeks of age. Locally available ingredients should be dried in the shade (the sun may destroy important vitamins) and grounded in a mortar before mixing. Plastic containers or matchboxes may be used for measuring different ingredients. 

Mixed feeds should not be stored for more than a month to avoid contamination. After eight weeks of age. chicken can be offered feed in a cafeteria system saving time and energy on mixing feeds.   

Ingredient for chick diet
1. Crushed maize/sorghum or millet1 kg container
2. Cereals by-products 1 kg container
3. Sunflower/sesame/groundnut cake 2 match boxes
4. Bone meaI/burnt egg shells 1 match box
5. Omena/fish meal 2 match boxes
6. Dried sesbania/Ieucaena/calliandra leaves 2 match boxes
Termites or maggots should be added to chicken feed especially during the ?rst 8 weeks. Alternatively a commercial chick starter ration can be used from day old to 8 weeks of age to ensure that chicks meet their daily requirements.   


## Technique for Growing Maggorts and Termites

Maggots and termites are a cheap source of protein. To grow Maggots mix poultry waste and water in a large open pot in a ratio of2:1. Place the pot away from public places since the smell may be offensive. The pot is left open during the day to allow flies to lay eggs in the mixture and covered at night. After 5 -10 days (depending on temperature) the maggots hatch and feed on the mixture. They may be harvested by gently pouring water into the pot. The maggots will ?oat and should be washed and fed to the chicken.
To grow termites ?ll a short necked pot (10 litres capacity) with poultry waste and straw and sprinkle with a little water. Set the pot upside down. After a day. the pot will be full of termites which should be offered to the chicken. 

## Amount to Feed
During the ?rst eight weeks (chick stage) chicks should be confined and offered a chick starter diet as shown in Table No. 8 .After 8 weeks of age the scavenging chicken meet part their feed requirement from the surrounding, however there is need to supplement based of the season, age and locality.   

Table No.8: Amount of feed at differet ages of local poultry

NOTE:
1. It is important to note that the nutritional requirements of chicken may be met by offering a variety of feeds.
2. It is best to provide fresh feed at all times.   


## Cafeteria System

Mature chicken are able to mix their own feed according to their needs. The best way to feed semi-inlensively managed birds above 8 weeks of age is a cafeteria system, whereby various types of feeds are offered separately.
In the cafeteria system, there should be at least one feeding compartment for:
a) Energy rich feeds, e.g. maize, millet, white sorghum.
b) Protein rich feeds, e.g., oil cakes, fish, omena, soya bean meal. green gram, maggots, and termites.
c) Mineral rich feeds, e.g. bone meal, burnt eggshells.

Observe the feeding behavior and avoid feeding unnecessary amounts and types of feeds.



## Common Feedstuff Problems

Common feedstuff problems include:
+ Fish meal can give a ?shy taste to meat and eggs. May contain excessive amounts of salt.
+ Cassava tubers contain cyanide, which is toxic, and the tubers must be sliced and dried in the sun before feeding.
+ Oil seed cakes can contain excessive amounts of oil and ?bre, which lower digestibility of the feed.
+ Beans contain a number ofanti~nutritional components and should be dried in the sun or cooked for a short period


## Feeders and Drinkers

Feeders and drinkers should always be kept clean to prevent the spread ofdiseases. They should be big enough for all birds of the same age to feed at the same time. A mature chicken requires 12cm of feeding space and 6cm drinking space. Feeders and drinkers may be made out of local materials.
