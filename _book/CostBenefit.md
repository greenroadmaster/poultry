# Cost Benefit Analysis of a Chicken Production system

## Economics of Chicken Production

## Economic Analysis and Simple Risk Assessment

Before starting any poultry production enterprise, calculate if it is economically feasible, thereby making the right decisions regarding the production system and the necessary interventions.

## Revenue
Revenue or income is all the money earned in relation to the chicken enterprise such as:
- Income from sale of live birds, e.g. growers, cockerels or spent hens;
- Income from sale of eggs;
- Value of eggs or chicken eaten or given away.

Value the standing stock, e.g. the production flock which is the foundation of future income. Chicken manure also represents a value when used on the farm or sold for other activities. Manure reduces the cost of buying fertilizer and improves crop production.

## Expenditure
These are costs involved in relation to the Chicken enterprise:
+ Material for baskets, shelters or Chicken houses;
+ Starting up flock e.g. Growers, hens or cocks;
+ Fertile eggs for incubation;
+ Day old chicks;
+ Supplementary feed, vitamins or minerals;
+ Vaccines and other medication;
+ Labour and technical advice.   

When the birds are offered crops (cereals or forage) that would otherwise be sold, this also represents a value and should be included in the calculation. Money acquired through loans, the repayment and interest on loans is also an expense that has to be included among the inputs. In a free range system where outputs are usually low, the inputs are also low. This means that expenses for buildings and other equipment are kept at a minimum. 

Small basket or shelters may be built using locally available materials without incurring high costs. Economics of indigenous chicken production Scavehging feed resources may not support large flock sizes above 6-10 adults and 20-30 growers and Chicks. In the example referred to in Table 2, the flock size is initially 10 hens and i cock, all indigenous Chicken. A production may also start with less, i.e. only a hen laying eggs, fertilized by a free range cock from a neighbor.
With 1 cock and 10 hens, of which no more than 6 hens at any given time are allowed to go broody, the flock size may grow to a maximum of 48 growers and ii adults which is manageable for a semi intensive poultry enterprise
(Figu re 3).

Improved management and feeding increases egg production ofthe non-broody hens to 104 eggs per hen per year, i.e. 2 eggs per week on average.

Table 2: Annanl input and output of a semi
intensive indigenous chicken enterprise   

Assumptions:
1. *(12 eggs laid=10 eggs hatched = 8 chicks surviving after 4 months)
2. The third batch will attain marketable age in the second year
3. Broody hens will also on average lay 2 eggs per week, excluding 2 x 3 weeks hatching (sitting on eggs) + 2 x 5 weeks brooding, i.e. 2 x 8 weeks = 16 weeks non-laying period per year. Annually each hen will then lay; 52 - 16 weeks = 36 weeks x 2 eggs = 72 eggs/hen/year.
4. A well-managed broody hen will sit on 12 eggs and hatch on average 10 chicks (about 80% hatchability).
5. Using the basket system (housing) and improved management, chick mortality will reduce to a maximum of l chick out of ten during the first 4 weeks (equal to 10%) and l grower out of nine in the remaining 20 weeks.
6. At the age of 22-24 weeks, when the growers are sold, on average 8 growers per batch will be alive.
7. Using six broody hens, a total of 6 x 8 growers = 48 birds may be sold twice a year.
A welI-managed production plan means selling birds at the time of highest price, and buying feeds, new hens or inputs (e.g. feeders and drinkers) at the time of the lowest cost. For many farmers this means keeping the birds in the flock until the festive season (e.g. Ramadhan, Christmas, Easter or national holidays), where they may get a price often two or three times the normal price. However, it is important to stress that keeping birds in the flock means more feed and a higher risk in terms of losing birds through predators, diseases or theft. In general birds should be sold at maturity, e.g. 22-32 weeks of age.

In the example, in Table 2 and 3, the cost of feeding one bird was KES. 56 every 4 weeks, as one kg feed costing KES.4O would be spent during 4 weeks. In such a case to keep a Chicken for an extra 4 weeks in the flock, you should be sure to gain more than KES. 110.50, from the market price, otherwise, it would be profitable to sell 4 weeks earlier at a lower price. Analysis of markets and environmental conditions will allow planning on when to
sell, restock and hatch
