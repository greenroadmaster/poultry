# Chicken Disease Control

## Vaccination Program

This is an example of vaccination program. Individual programs are highly variable and reflect local conditions, disease prevalence, severity of challenge, and individual preferences.

The use of M gallisepticum vaccine is regulated or prohibited in some states. SB-1 or MDV301 may be combined with turkey herpesvirus in some areas, or Rispens strain may be used in high-challenge areas. Vaccination for infectious bursal disease, laryngotracheitis, and fowlpox depends on local requirements. Other strains of infectious bronchitis (Connecticut, Arkansas 99, Florida 88, etc) are included in some areas. M gallisepticum and Haemophilus gallinarum (coryza) are used only on infected, multiage premises in some areas.

Disease is any change or impairment of normal body function that affects the chickens’ ability to survive. grow, produce and reproduce. Understanding the causes of diseases and the method of spread (transmission) will assist in disease control. The clinical signs of a disease and characteristic lesions found at post- mortem will help in its diagnosis and institution of preventative measures.

Diseases:
+ Kill
+ Interfere with normal growth
+ Reduce productivity (eggs/meat)
+ Lead to heavy losses
+ Affect local and international trade in livestock products

## Causes of Disease
Infectious diseases are caused by organisms that can be transmitted from one chicken to another. Such organisms include viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoans. Other infectious organisms are external (lice, fleas and ticks] or internal (roundworms, tapeworms, flukes] parasites.   

In many cases, diseases result from a combination of factors such as, nutrition, environmental and flock management. All these have a direct and important influence on health and productivity of chicken.

## Factors Influencing the Health Status of Chicken

### Chicken

+ General condition
+ Age
+ Stress
+ Inherited characteristics
+ Susceptibility to disease

### Environment

+ Climate(temperature, rain, wind)
+ Housing conditions
+ Availability of water
+ Availability of feed
+ Feed Quality
+ Air Quality

### Infectious Agents

+ Viruses
+ Bacteria
+ Mycoplasma
+ Fungi
+ Parasites

## Characteristics of Healthy Chicken

- Alert and on guard
- Bright eyes and comb
- Walk, run, stand and scratch
- Eating and drinking
- Hens normally lay eggs
- Normally smooth and neat feathers
- Soft compact droppings
- Quietly breathing   

## Characteristics of Unhealthy Chicken

- Tired and lifeless
- Dull eyes and comb
- Sit or lie down
- Eat and drink less
- Lay less or stop laying eggs
- Ruffled and loose feathers
- Wet droppings with blood or worms, diarrhea
- Cough, sneeze and breathe noisily.


## Costs Associated with Disease

- Mortality/death
- Reduced productivity
- weight gain/egg  production
- Downgrading at processing
- Treatment
- Vaccination
- Surveillance and monitoring
- Loss of market
- Public health control

Note : Preventing disease is better and generally cheaper than treatment. Preventing diseases in indigenous chicken by use of vaccination and improved management is the most cost-effective approach for disease control.

## Categories of Common Chicken Diseases
Diseases in chicken maybe divided into three categories and the importance ofa disease is judged by its mortality rate and effect on production;

a) Diseases of High importance:
These are diseases with high mortality (more than 30% of the flock), highly contagious and difficult to treat.
They include diseases such as;
- Newcastle Disease
- Gumboro (Infectious Bursal Disease, IBD)
- Avian Influenza (Al)
- Fowl pox
- Fowl cholera (pasteurellosis)
- Coccidiosis (internal parasites)

b) Diseases of Medium importance
These are diseases with medium mortality (10-30% of the ?ock) and/or dif?cult to treat. They include diseases
such as
- Pullorum disease (Baciillary white diarrhoea)
- Gumboro (Infectious Bursal Disease, IBD)
- Infectious coryza
- Chronic respiratory disease (Mycoplasmosis)
- Roundworms and tapeworms (Internal parasites
- Mycotoxicosis (fungal poisoning)
- External Parasites

c) Diseases of less importance:
Not common, with lower mortality and/or easy treatment.
- Mareks disease
- E. coli infection
- Scaly legs
- Nutritional diseases
